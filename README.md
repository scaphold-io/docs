Official [Scaphold.io](https://scaphold.io) API Documentation
------------

Welcome to the official API documentation for Scaphold.io, GraphQL backend-as-a-service. We're happy you're here!

Feel free to peruse the source code, or check out the [LIVE documentation page](https://scaphold.io/docs).

If you'd like to make an edit to any of these pages, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/scaphold-io/docs/pulls) and we'll make the update as soon as possible.
For reference on how to run this page locally, please take a look below. We use an easy-to-use tool called [Slate](https://lord.github.io/slate) to power our documentation.

Getting Started
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.0 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

1. Fork this repository on Github.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/docs.git`
3. `cd docs`
4. Initialize and start. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that the Docs are all set up your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish the docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).
