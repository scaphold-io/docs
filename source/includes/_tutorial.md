# Tutorial

## Introduction

First things first: GraphQL is awesome. If you’re not already building on it, right now is a great time to start! As a quick introduction, GraphQL is an application layer query language designed by Facebook that is used to power many of their web and mobile applications. A GraphQL API comes preloaded with a rich type system that makes it easy to represent complex data models, introspective capabilities that make documenting an API a breeze, and an intuitive query language that greatly improves the experience of developing client applications.

This tutorial is going to take place in multiple parts. This section is **Part 1** and over the next few minutes, we will walk through creating a production ready GraphQL API on Scaphold. The objective is to show you that anyone can get started with the awesomeness that is GraphQL. Future posts will walk you through how to build client applications using React, React Native and Angular 2.0 using Apollo Client and RelayJS.

Get ready to forever replace REST with GraphQL, the future of APIs.

Let’s get building!
